# 👋 Hi, I'm Ahmet (@SekmenAhmet)

I'm a developer who loves building things **and understanding how they work under the hood**.

I started with web development (TypeScript / React / NestJS), and lately I've been going deeper into **low-level programming** — especially **C**, **Python**, and **x86_64 Assembly**.

I enjoy learning **deep concepts**, writing clean code, and exploring how software behaves close to the machine.

---

## 🧠 What I like working on

- Low-level programming fundamentals (memory, CPU, performance, OS concepts)
- APIs and backend architecture (from my web dev experience)
- Projects where I can learn real-world engineering patterns
- Anything that makes me go: *"wait… how does this actually work?"*

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Low-level / Systems (currently focusing on)
- **C**
- **x86_64 Assembly**
- **Python**

### Web / Backend (background)
- **TypeScript**
- **React**
- **Node.js**
- **NestJS**
- REST APIs

---

## 🌱 Currently learning / improving
- Low-level development and debugging mindset
- Memory / stack / calling conventions (x86_64)
- Writing more structured and maintainable C projects
- Going deeper into how programs interact with the OS

## 📌 A bit of my dev journey
I’ve worked a lot on web development projects (frontend + backend), and I really enjoyed building APIs and designing clean backend structures.

But lately, I’ve been shifting my focus toward **low-level programming**, because I want to understand what really happens beneath the abstractions: from memory layouts to instructions running on the CPU.
